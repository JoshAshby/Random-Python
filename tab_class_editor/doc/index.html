Welcome to the PyTe Help File.<br>
PyTe stands for PythonTexteditor, and is a Code(even if it says text) editor that has been written to meet my(Josh Ashby) needs.<br>
PyTe is writen in python, with the gui made in PyQt4; it includes a basic web browser(QtWebView) and a Scinitlla code editor that allows me to look at a web page with a tutorial on programming, and code all in the same window. This also allows me to work on a website, and view it without having to flip between windows.<br>
<br>
Config.cfg holds the configuration data, color of the editors different areas, and the font family that the editor uses.
